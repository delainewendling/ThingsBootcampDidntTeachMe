# Things Bootcamp Didn't Teach Me

A collection of notes I've taken while starting my first software job. This repo contains a collection of topics that were not taught at my bootcamp (Nashville Software School) that I have learned on the job.

The original version of this document will contain only links to resources. The finished version will be crafted into a narrative to help other bootcamp students get a sense of what you will be learning in the first 30 days on the job.
